## Gift Wrapping Algorithm to Solve Convex Hull Problem

The algorithm of Gift Wrapping (aka Jarvis March) is simple.                                                                                
we start from leftmost point (or undermost/ it can be change) and                                                                         
we keep wrapping points in counterclockwise direction. 

We use orientation notation to find next point out.                                                                                       
Next point is selected as the point that beats all other points                                                                           
at counterclockwise orientation.
